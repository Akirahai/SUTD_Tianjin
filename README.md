# EX and NNA TSP Project  

This project implements the Exhaustive Search (EX) Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The project consists of two main scripts: `TSPnna.py` for running the NNA algorithm and `TSPex.py` for running EX algorithm.  

## Prerequisites  

You install the required libraries using pip with requirements:  

```bash  
pip install requirements.txt
```  

## Running the Scripts  

### To change the count of seconds for the car to run in each kinds of line and the turning time, refer to the libs.py

### To run the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA):  

```bash  
python TSPnna.py  
```  

### To run the example scenarios:  

```bash  
python TSPex.py  
```  

## Output  

The outputs of both scripts will all be saved into the folder `output` You can find all the necessary file in the same directory where the scripts are located.
